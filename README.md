# ieee_single_precision_floating_point_multiplier
This Verilog project design an IEEE Single Precision Floating Point Multiplier. This project was made for my Introduction to VLSI Design class.

The procedure was to first design an IEEE Single Precision Floating Point Multiplier. In this case, we had to lookup how it was designed and how to implement the code on Verilog
